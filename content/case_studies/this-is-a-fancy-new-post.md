## **1. Introduction**

In January 2020 an e-mail was written by me in reply to a question about what my opinion was of Aurcana Corporation. It generated a degree of interest which I found surprising for such a small company. The e-mail was not of the usual detail and rigorousness of my more formal reports. It also resulted in a reply from a representative of Aurcana, which addressed the various points made. This was received just before my departure on a 3-week trip. The Aurcana response was distributed to all Followers to place it on record and not get the issues go stale.

Upon return from my travels I have submitted requests for more information, but have yet to receive this 5 days later. It seems Aurcana has lost interest taking the discussion further and there is nothing to stop me to give my views based on available information.

This note has been drawn up to elaborate on the main concerns about Aurcana and its Revenue-Virginius project in Colorado, USA, providing more detail than the comments in the e-mail.

The main concerns with most relevance about perceived risk/return revolve around:

* The resource and reserves, in particular the prospective degree of dilution.
* The saleable products.
* The mining method and its implication for scale of operation and operating cost.

To place these concerns into context it is required to review some of the technical information provided in the NI.43-101 compliant technical report on the feasibility study for the Revenue-Virginius mine, dated 30 July 2018, authored by SRK Consulting (US) Incorporated (“SRK”).

## **2. Geological Background to the Revenue-Virginius Project**

The mineralisation in the project area is in narrow fissure veins related to several caldera events. The initial doming and subsequent collapse of these calderas formed a very complex pattern of concentric and radial fractures that control most of the veins and dikes in the region.

Mineralisation in the veins is characterised by somewhat constrained vertical extents (generally less than 1,000 ft/300 m) and a vertical zoning with higher precious metal grade in the upper levels changing to more base-metal rich mineralisation with depth.

There are three main veins (refer to Figure 2_1):

* Yellow Rose, close to the existing portal to the underground workings, and
* Virginius and Terrible in close proximity to each other, but at more than 5,000 feet from the portal.

By far most of the historical production came from Virginius.

Figure 2_1 Location of the Three Main Veins

![](/images/veins.png)

All three are narrow quartz veins with a thickness ranging from several inches up to 6 ft with a resource average of 1.1 ft as per page 1 of the technical report. Page 55 of the report gives an average width of 1.3 ft for the Virginius vein resources with the Yellow Rose vein being wider, but lower grade, and the Terrible vein being narrower.

The Virginius vein is associated with a dike unit. Three units were recognised depending on whether the vein is completely within the dike, or sits in the footwall or hanging wall of the dike. SRK attempted to model these individual zones, but had to give up due to “inconsistent sampling and less continuity” in the footwall and hanging wall units (page 137). Wireframes for the Virginius vein move between all three sub-domains.

The report is generally somewhat vague about the consistency of the vein structures. There are indications that veins could be disrupted/offset in places and SRK specifically states it did not model offsets by faulting or dikes (page 135).

Figure 2_2 contains a cross section showing an example of the latest drilling carried out, which has been reproduced to illustrate how the vein trace has smoothed out small scale variations and the considerable interpolation between holes by underground and surface drilling. This impression may be fallacious, but there is not enough information in the technical report on small scale consistency.

Figure 2_2 Cross Section as Example of Latest Drilling

![](/images/crosssection.png)

Minerals include galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), tetrahedrite (Cu,Fe,Zn,Ag)12Sb4S13, polybasite (Ag,Cu)16(Sb,As)2S11), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), pyrite (FeS2), arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and marcasite (FeS). Silver is the metal of primary importance and is associated primarily with the tetrahedrite (75%) and polybasite (25%). Concentration of these antimony and arsenic containing minerals may result in penalties/problems with marketing the product(s). Page 132 of the feasibility study report states: “significant quantities of arsenic and antimony were found in the lead concentrate. The zinc concentrate contained significant levels of arsenic and cadmium”.

According to Aurcana there is a “Bluequest report” that would indicate an As and Sb content of 10% of concentrates from the ores from Silver Valley, the relevance of which is not immediately obvious. A copy of the Bluequest report was requested, but not received. Without this report and how it is relevant to the Revenue- Virginius project, the issue remains of concern.

**3. Exploration**

Much of the exploration data is old, pre-2001, and with limited documentation available on methods and techniques used. These include 161 core holes drilled from surface and 309 core holes drilled underground and 1,286 underground channel samples.

The channel samples were collected along the vein and are 6-10 feet apart. These samples were “focused on particular sections of various veins” and therefore not random and not necessarily representative of the vein.

During 2011 – 2013 another 30 holes were drilled from surface and 22 from underground with 201 underground channel samples, taken in the same manner as older channel samples.

Between 2014 and 2015 a total of 608 channel samples were taken.

After 2015 underground drilling amounted to 42 holes from 4 cross cuts targeting the Virginius Vein and 59 channel samples as part of Resue mining test stoping campaign. The channel samples for 2016 test stoping averaged 10 oz/t Ag and for the 2017 test stope 5 oz/t Ag. These averages are very low compared to the declared average resource grade and explained in the feasibility study report as due to being from a location selected for the test stope was in an easily accessible lower grade area. This is possible, but it could also reflect a general lower grade for the vein than modelled.

According to page 143 of the feasibility study report, the average distance between drill holes ranges between 76 and 125 feet, or between approx. 23 m and 38 m. For the type of mineralisation, these distances are considerable and introduce uncertainty to interpolations. For stope design additional delineation drilling will be required.

**4. Resource Estimation**

Based on review of the cumulative distribution curves of raw assay data SRK selected assay caps of between 10 oz/st and 325 oz/st depending on the resource domain. Yet, when reviewing the table with the summary between raw and capped values some very strange numbers are evident. Capping values reduces the variance of a population and should result in a reduction of the coefficient of variance (“CV” = calculated as standard deviation/mean). The table provided by SRK shows this to be the case for gold (CV dropping from 22.55 to 2.60) and copper (27.19 dropping to 11.03) whereas CV’s for Ag and Pb remain virtually constant (respectively 13.98 to 12.67 and 10.44 to 10.18), whereas it i**ncreases** for Zn (42.59 to 43.95). Mathematically, it does not make sense.

It gets stranger. For grade estimation the sample lengths, which vary greatly from 0.1 ft to 6 ft, were composited to a standard length. Compositing of assay values was to 2 ft length for Virginius and 3 ft for Yellow Rose. Compositing of assay values averages extreme values, thereby resulting in less variability. Yet this is not reflected in the table with summary statistics for the main veins on page 142. The number of composites **exceeds** the number of raw data (e.g. for the Main Vein 1,786 composites versus 1,613 raw assays and for Yellow Rose 637 versus 595 raw data) with the CV for the composite values almost the same and in the case of gold values for the FW vein and Terrible Vein **increasing** compared to the raw data. It does not make mathematical sense.

From the description of the exploration database in the previous report section it is evident that channel samples by far exceed drill intercept data. To prevent channel sample data having an overwhelming effect on the estimation and therefore introducing bias, their weighting needs to be reduced. This is achieved by a method called “declustering” which assigns a much lower weighting to the channel samples in close proximity than other samples at greater distance from each other. Figure 4_1 shows a longitudinal section of a portion of the Virginius vein illustrating declustered means (circles) compared to raw data (crosses).

Figure 4_1 Declustered (circles) Versus Composite Sample Data (crosses)

![](/images/longitudinalsection.png)

Whereas the procedure is mitigating, the strongly clustered nature of the data set as shown above remains a risk factor in the resource estimation.

SRK failed to produce meaningful and interpretable directional variograms, which is according to SRK due to “short scale variability which could be a function of a high variable (nuggety) style deposit”. For this reason, it has chosen Inverse Distance (“ID”) methodology to estimate block grades using a large block size of 50 ft x 50 ft (= 15 m x 15 m) “to produce a more smoother estimate”.

It is enlightening to compare the block values to the underlying composite grades in cross section as shown in Figure 4_2 for the silver grade block model for the Virginius Main Vein.

Figure 4_2 Longitudinal Section Through the Ag Block Model for the Main Vein

The section above shows the large blocks in yellow, orange and red, which denote high grade blocks, based on very little supporting date, extrapolated over a large distance. An example is the large area of red on the left hand side which seems to be purely based on channel sample values extrapolated down and up, even beyond the outline of the mined-out area, the outline of which may well be determined by sub-economic grades encountered during mining. At least these blocks have been categorised “Inferred” and not included in the life of mine (“LOM”) plan. The high-grade blocks below channel sampled drive have however been classified “Measured” Resources and are included in the LOM production plan.

It does not give much confidence about the validity of declared resources/reserves.

Table 4_1 gives the Resource Statement as at 1 March 2017 based on a cut-off grade of US$200/st net smelter return value.

The resource statement provided by SRK includes copper grades, but these have been ignored in the table above as the LOM plan does not include copper as an economic mineral.

The Virginius vein accounts for almost 79% of the silver contained in Measured and Indicated (“M&I”) Resources, followed by 17% for Yellow Rose and Terrible for the balance. For all intents and purposes only two veins matter.

Noticeable are the much higher grades for Inferred Resources at Virginius compared to resources with higher confidence and for Inferred Resources at Yellow Rose compared to Indicated Resources. The discussion on Figure 4_2 is the explanation for this difference and places a large question mark behind these grades.

The information on the sensitivity of the resources to cut-off grade assumed shows this to be almost unrelated to cut-off value with a drop of 50% resulting in an increase of only 7% in silver metal contained in M&I Resources for the Virginius vein. This is a reflection of the abrupt drop in grade between vein and host rock and the assumption in the resource estimation of very well-defined shoots that abruptly change grade along strike. The technical report gives however poor substantiation for this assumption.

**5. Reserve Estimation**

The reserve estimation assumed a highly selective mining method called Resue mining. This method was used at Virginius in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s. It is very labour intensive and of questionable merit in a country such as the USA as will be discussed in Section 6. Based on trial mining in 2016 the applied stope dilution is based on the relationship:

_Dilution (%) = (-0.127 x natural logarithm of vein width in feet + 0.1995) x 100_

Figure 5_1 shows the data on which this relationship is based.

| --- |
| Figure 5_1 Mining Dilution – 2016 Test Mining  |

The average dilution for vein width of between 1.0 and 1.3 feet is therefore below 20% and the relationship is very much determined by one data point of 6.4% dilution for a vein width of 1.08 feet. When this is ignored the relationship changes to a linear one:

_Dilution (%) = (-0.19 x vein width in feet + 0.43) x 100_

The dilution amounts to almost a constant width of 0.24 feet, irrespective of the vein width, which makes sense as overbreak is not really a function of vein width. Based on this it would appear SRK has used a too optimistic dilution assumption.

In 2017 follow-up test mining was carried out which according to SRK that the 2016 dilution relationship “reasonably represents the stope dilution”. However, Figure 5_2 shows differently.

| --- |
| Figure 5_2 Mining Dilution – 2017 Test Mining  |

The relationship, when forced to be logarithmic, has changed considerably to:

_Dilution (%) = (-0.76 x vein width in feet + 0.346) x 100_

Two aspects stand out:

*  The relationship is again very much determined by one value of 14.5% dilution at a vein width of 1.2 feet. However, even accepting this value, the average amount of overbreak of 0.28 feet is remarkably close to the 0.24 feet in 2016.
*  The average overbreak is much higher (usually >50%) when only considering the dilution at stations with vein width of less than 1.0 feet.

Based on the above the rates of dilution between 5.9% and 26.8% applied by SRK are probably far too optimistic. Moreover, Section 6 will point out another important consideration why the established dilution estimation may be very much under rated.

The cut-off grade used for reserve estimation is expressed as a net smelter return (“NSR”) value based on metal prices of US$18.55/oz for Ag, US$1,270/oz Au, US$.95/lb Pb and US$1.15/lb Zn (not very different from currently prevailing prices) and conventional marketing terms, including a low penalty of US$2.27/st per each 0.1% increment above 0.3% Sb. No penalties are included for As and Cd. Total cash operating cost of US$240.5/st were assumed, which includes all development cost within a stope.

Table 5_1 gives the Reserve Statement as at 15 June 2018.

| Conversion (%) | 58.3 | 125.6 | 116.1 | 121.3 | 108.9 | 73.2 | 64.3 | 70.7 | 63.4 |

The table shows that 73% of the silver contained in M&I resources are converted to reserves and that, despite dilution, the assumed Ag feed grade is almost 26% higher than the resource grade. Also very strange is the difference in upgrading of the various grades. Why would the grade of silver go proportionally substantially more up than for Zn: 25.6% versus 8.8% for Zn? According to Aurcana this is explained by silver being the economic driver of the project and blocks with higher silver grade being preferentially converted to reserves.

However, when analysing the conversion factors in more detail it becomes apparent the main reason for the higher silver grade in reserves is the 43% upgrading of the silver grade of Indicated Virginius resources from 21.3 oz/st to 30.4 oz/st, despite substantial dilution! Similar, but less extreme upgrades are evident for Au, Pb and Zn, respectively +20%, +29% and +26%. **There is something very strange here and it places a major question mark behind the average reserve grades.**

**6. Mining Method**

The only way the Revenue-Virginius project can be made economical is by avoiding as much as possible dilution of the resource grades. For this reason, the business plan envisages a highly selective mining method called Resue Mining. Resue mining is a method whereby waste and ore are drilled and blasted separately.

The mine design considers stope blocks having minimum dimensions of 500 ft to 1,000 ft along strike and up to 300 ft in height. The width of the stopes varies according to the mineralisation with a minimum design width of 42 inches (= 1.07 m).

The technical report describes the planned method as follows (refer to Figure 6_1 with a longitudinal section of the stope design and Figure 6_2 with also a cross section):

| --- |
| Figure 6_1 Longitudinal Section Through Stope Design  |

| --- |
| Figure 6_2 Long Section and Cross Section Through Stope Design  |

An off-ore access drift is developed on the footwall along the length of the stope (orange outline in the cross section). Two-compartment raises known as cribbed manways (in purple colour in Figure 6_2) are developed on each end of the stope from the level below providing access to any level of the stope. In the centre of the stope a three-compartment service raise with a manway, ore pass, and equipment slide is constructed as the primary access. Each raise will have utilities run up into the stope so that miners can pull water or air from either side of the stope or from the middle service raise.

The bottom portion of the stope, approximately 25 ft in height, is left in a pillar (sill pillar, brown in Figure 6_1 and grey in Figure 6_2), which is partially recoverable from the stope below. A 3.5 ft wide scram drift is developed along the length of the stope above the pillar. Finger raises with ore chutes at the access level connect the scram drift to the development access below and are used to remove ore material from the stopes.

Figure 6_3 has been included to show what some of the technical terms such as “slusher” refer to.

| --- |
| Figure 6_3 Stope Design  |

Once the scram and finger raises are established, up-holes are drilled into the vein, both in ore and waste (red lines in Figure 6_3). Ore material is blasted first and then removed using slushers, operating on a conveyor belt muck sheet, to the finger raise for transportation to the process facility. Prior to blasting the waste material, cribbed timbers are placed to raise the ore passes (similarly to the manway and service raises) to the next level. Waste material is then blasted and left in the stope as fill material for accessing the next level of the stope. Where necessary, additional waste can be drilled and blasted to ensure fill volume in the stope is appropriate as mining progresses.

From the description above it is evident the method is labour intensive and slow, yielding very little ore per shift. This is especially so as the waste needs to be covered with conveyor belting before blasting the ore to avoid mixing the high-grade ore with the waste fill underneath when scraping it with the slusher bucket. Also glibly ignored is the fact the amount of waste will never be exactly as required, sometimes too little to generate sufficient platform, in other instances too much. It means additional time will have to be included to bring waste into the stope section, or removed it out of the stope.

Resue mining is a very unusual mining method about which even very little has been published. I was unable to find an example on the internet of a mine using this method, but according to Aurcana “it is a mining method that has been well proven in North and South America. It is used by Great Panther for their mines in Mexico and the Coricancha mine in Peru.”

This statement is somewhat misleading as:

*  The Coricancha “mine” is a closed down open pit operation which Great Panther is planning to re-open and for which it **considers** using Resue mining. The Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA”) dated July 2018 suggested using Resue Mining and Great Panther approved a positive production decision following the completion of a bulk sample program which “confirmed the key operating assumptions contained in the PEA”. Great Panther is however currently still establishing the set of conditions under which a return to operations can commence. Obviously, all is not that straightforward/attractive. Moreover, with the acquisition of Tucano, Great Panther has at last an operation with some critical mass for the company, producing more than 0.14 Moz per annum. Being a listed company and incurring overheads of US$5-6 million per annum, Great Panther could never generate net free cash flow with the small mines they had before Tucano, let alone carry the corporate overheads. Coricancha seems to have dropped far down the list of priorities.
*  The “mines in Mexico” referred to above are the Guanajuato and San Ignacio mines where cut-and-fill mining is employed over widths of 1.8 m to 2.4 m depending on the vein width and the Topia mine where Resue mining is employed.

So basically, there is one mine given as an example where Resue mining is actually employed. When referring to the description of the method at Topia in a NI.43-101 technical report dated 28 February 2019 the following is clear:

*  The minimum mining width is 1 foot, which the resource grades reflect by diluting to this minimum width.
*  Mining is feeding a plant at an average calendar rate of 200 tpd, close to what is planned by Aurcana for Revenue-Virginius.
*  Drilling of blast holes are not as uppers planned by Aurcana but as horizontal holes, because it was found uppers generated a ragged back and led to problems with ground support.
*  Blasting of the ore separate from the waste is greatly assisted by slips on the contact resulting in vein material to easily separate from host rock. **This major advantage is not evident from the description of the Revenue-Virginius project.**
*  The operation is very labour intensive with hand mucking of ore in the stope after hand sorting at the work place. After dropping the sorted high-grade material down a chute, it is loaded in small rail cars and hand trammed to the portal.
*  There is some cross faulting, but to a minor degree, which results in additional dilution.
*  No reserves are declared, which is probably too costly an exercise for the size of operation. However, the silver grade of production in the last few years is typically 28% lower than the M&I resources silver grade. This is **after** hand sorting diminishes the effect of dilution.

From the above it is safe to conclude Aurcana has little actual mining experience to draw from to rely on Resue mining. It was probably for this reason the company had two trial mining campaigns. However, upon reviewing the details of these campaigns it is clear they were of very limited scope as evident from Figure 6_4. Unfortunately, the illustration does not have a bar scale, but from another illustration in the feasibility study report (Figure 15-3) the 2016 exercise was over 130 feet strike length, or approx. 40 m. It must have involved development of the scram drive and some very limited mining of mineralised material at the back of the stope.

| --- |
| Figure 6_4 Scope of Test Mining in 2016 (blue) and 2017 (yellow and green)  |

Referring to the implied 2016 trial mining length, the cram drive in 2017 was extended by approx. 25 m and with mineralised material mined over this length by drilling uppers (2nd in green). Approx. 19 m of mineralised material was also mined from the cram drive developed in 2016.

Given the above, very little could have been learned about practical cycle time, control of dilution upon continuing mining further lifts and the practicality of slushing over conveyor belts, adding/removing waste material. etc.

I have been involved as Independent Technical experts for 2 banks providing project finance to the Blue Ridge PGM mine in South Africa. The business plan was based on trial mining “an Effective Cut” that would supposedly control dilution. Our report warned the banks about the danger of relying on trial mining, because it is by its very nature not representative given all the supervisory attention it gets. And so it proved to be. The project failed because of poor grade control during operations. The same risk is with Aurcana’s project. Figure 6_5 shows the degree of dilution for each blasting section.

| --- |
| Figure 6_5 Dilution (blue) and Vein Width at Each Mined Section  |

The above diagram clearly shows an increasing trend to higher dilution with higher section numbers (and supposedly time), not fully explained by vein width.

The diagram points to the risk that over time and away from a well-defined selected initial section, both along strike and away from the cram drive, dilution control will get increasingly difficult.

**7. Reality Check**

Resue mining was employed during production at Virginius from 1895 until 1912. The feasibility study document only has complete records for the years 1901 and 1904-1906 plus totals for the period 1901-1906. This shows average milled grades of 15.45 oz/st Ag with similar grades for the individual years when this can be calculated.

Assuming the resource grades have not changed much over time (considering the low sensitivity of resources to cut-off grade changes), the milled grade was 33% lower than the current declared mineral resources grade for Virginius Main. This may well provide a good indication for the dilution that can be expected. Yet, it should be remembered that the precious metal grades at shallower levels are higher than where future mining is envisaged. This points to the risk of dilution having been higher when milled grade is divided by a grade higher than the current resources grade.

**8. Cash Operating Cost**

Total cash operating cost are forecast at US$95/st for mining, US$51/st for processing, US$8 million per annum G&A and another US$1 million for surface operating cost (= concentrate haulage, winter road operations, light vehicles operating cost, other surface equipment).

According to Aurcana, all mining cost were determined based on first principles. A request for more detail on the estimation and what was included has gone unanswered. Costing on a first principle basis only includes that was is considered and runs the risks of oversights. It is for example unclear whether the mining cost includes the considerable expense on underground delineation drilling to plan the stopes, grade control sampling, etc.

According to Aurcana cash flow sensitivity analysis “irrefutably” shows that dilution up to 120% has no material impact on cash flow. A statement like this, which goes against all conventional guidelines, makes one wonder how rigorous the analysis was on which this conclusion was based. Aurcana promised to post the supporting presentation on their website, but it is not yet available.

It should be noted Great Panther indicates a mining cost of US$104 per metric tonne for Topia, which operates in a low-cost jurisdiction, especially in terms of staffing. Moreover, the Reenue-Virginius mine will have to support Aurcana corporate overheads on its own, which is a high burden for such a small producer. Being a listed company Aurcana will incur substantial compliance expenses. For the 9 months in 2019 the corporate overheads amounted to US$2.4 million, or US$3.2 million annualised. Once the mine is in operation corporate expenses are likely to rise further to comply will all kinds of statutory obligations. Over the 6.5-year LOM corporate expenses would add more than US$20 million to total cash outflows.

**9. Prospective Value and Risks**

The feasibility study arrives at a value of US$74 million using a discount rate of 5% and ignoring the corporate overhead cash outflows. For new projects a more appropriate discount rate is at least 7.5% to account for the higher risk of a project compared to a going concern. This together with corporate overheads would reduce the value by approx. US$22 million.

At the share price of C$0.215 on 28 February 2020 the market capitalisation of Aurcana is with 167.2 million shares (including the February placement of 15.1 million shares) C$36 million, or approx. US$27 million. The February 2020 share placement raised C$3.3 million (US$2.5 million), which is probably close to the cash burn since 30 September 2019, when the net current assets were US$5.6 million. This would make the Enterprise Value ignoring, any dilution, approx. US$21 million.

Comparing Enterprise Value with the value established by the feasibility study seems to point to the company being good value.

There are however a number of substantial risks associated with Aurcana:

*  It is not evident in the feasibility study that sufficient recognition was given to small scale disruptions and changes to the veins. Stope dimensions of at least 500 ft strike and 300 ft high compare very optimistically to the outline of historical workings at Virginius.
*  The resource estimation of a deposit with, in the words of SRK, short scale variability which could be a function of a high variable (nuggety) style deposit, has used long search radii despite semi-variograms not generating reliable structures. High grade blocks of considerable size have been defined on the basis of a few channel samples.
*  The reserve estimation includes a major silver grade increase of the Virginius vein’s Indicated resources, despite substantial dilution during mining.
*  The reserve estimation assumes dilution that is clearly lower than achieved by trial mining and compares low to implied dilution in historical production.
*  The project assumes employing Resue mining, being a very labour intensive and low productivity mining method in the USA where no such other operation exists. A high degree of uncertainty is therefore associated with productivity parameters, operating cost and sustaining capital expenditure.
*  The mining method has been tested on a very limited scale and without going through many cycles.
* Concentration of silver into a concentrate of minerals that also contain Sb and As, which could result in problems marketing the product.
* The substantiation of operating cost does not obviously include a number of activities that will be required.

It is for the above reasons why this report earned the title: **A Very High-Risk Proposition.**

There are more attractive, lower risk opportunities out there.
