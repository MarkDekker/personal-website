title = "Aurcana Corporation - A Very High Risk Proposition"

# Introduction

In January 2020 an e-mail was written by me in reply to a question about what my opinion was of Aurcana Corporation. It generated a degree of interest which I found surprising for such a small company. The e-mail was not of the usual detail and rigorousness of my more formal reports. It also resulted in a reply from a representative of Aurcana, which addressed the various points made. This was received just before my departure on a 3-week trip. The Aurcana response was distributed to all Followers to place it on record and not get the issues go stale.

Upon return from my travels I have submitted requests for more information, but have yet to receive this 5 days later. It seems Aurcana has lost interest taking the discussion further and there is nothing to stop me to give my views based on available information.

This note has been drawn up to elaborate on the main concerns about Aurcana and its Revenue-Virginius project in Colorado, USA, providing more detail than the comments in the e-mail.

The main concerns with most relevance about perceived risk/return revolve around:

* The resource and reserves, in particular the prospective degree of dilution.
* The saleable products.
* The mining method and its implication for scale of operation and operating cost.

To place these concerns into context it is required to review some of the technical information provided in the NI.43-101 compliant technical report on the feasibility study for the Revenue-Virginius mine, dated 30 July 2018, authored by SRK Consulting (US) Incorporated (“SRK”).
